Report:

Server and Client implemented to specifications. The project has been
tested on both my local MacOS and the departmental linux servers.

Note on log format output:
Carriage returns and line feed are translated to the
space character (0x20) to keep the log to two lines, as
stated in the specification.

When conducting the sanity check, I recieved the following output:

    SUBMISSION lab1b-105238261.tar.gz ... FAILS sanity check with 1 errors

I believe this is due to the fact that the tarball contains two
unexpected files:
    
    netconfig.sh
    netdefs.h

These are used to set the IP address of the server.
