    a. Investigate pause between ^C from terminal and exit



start_duplex_tty() and transmit_to_client() are
threads and so have prviate stacks:

The local variables in the main function are:
    1.) int sock_listen,
    2.) int sock_connect;
    3.) struct sockaddr_in my_addr;
    4.) struct sockaddr_in their_addr;
    5.) unsigned int sin_size <--- This local variable should be refactored out


Questionable design:
First, create a thread to execute start_duplex_tty()
In a seperate thread, start_duplex_tty() calls echo_and_forwrd().
However, echo_and_forward() contains a while(true) loop that


The we need to send() the data to the client as soon as we read it from
the pipe. It makes no sense to have a seperate thread for
reading the pipe and one for sending the data to the client
