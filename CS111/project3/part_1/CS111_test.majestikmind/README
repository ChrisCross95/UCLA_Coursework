inode_tbl_ptr[i].i_block[i] was the trouble 


Notes on EXT2 Filesystem: 

The Second Extended Filesystem:
	blocks: the basic unit of storage 
	inodes: the mean of keeping track of files and system objects
	block groups: logically split the disk into more manageable sections (partitions)
	directories: provide a hierarchical organization of files (directory tree)
	block and inode bitmaps: keep track of allocated blocks and inodes
	superblock: define the parameters of the file system and its overall state

	There's an inode for each block. Blocks are stored in block groups to reduce
	seek time and fragmentation. Information about each block group is kept in a 
	descriptor table stored in the block(s) immediately after the superblock.
	Since each bitmap is limited to a single block, this means that the maximum 
	size of a block group is 8 times the size of a block.

	Each object in the filesystem is represented by an inode. The inode structure
	contains pointers to the filesystem blocks which contain the data held in the 
	object and all of the metadata about an object except its name.

	All the inodes are stored in inode tables, with one inode table per block group.
	

	The superblock contains all the information about the configuration of the 
	filesystem. The primary copy of the superblock is stored at an offset of 1024
	bytes from the start of the device

	For all symlink shorter than 60 bytes long, the data is stored within the
	inode itself; it uses the fields which would normally be used to store the
	pointers to data blocks.
