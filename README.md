While pursuing my Philosophy PhD at UCLA, I became interested in programming and software development. During my free time, 
I took undergraduate computer science courses in a variety of topics. This repository contains the projects of the 
programming-intensive courses I took:

CS111: Operating Systems Principles 

CS118: Computer Networking Fundamental 

CS31: Introduction to Computer Science I

CS33: Introduction to Computer Science II (Data-structures and Algorithms)

CS33: Introduction to Computer Architecture
